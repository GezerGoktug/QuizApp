# Quiz App ‚ùì

**<p>In this project, I created a Quiz application with HTML CSS and JavaScript. Bootstrap CSS library was used in the design. When you go back to the previous questions, you can change your answers to the questions you have made. After the last question, your answers are evaluated and your score is calculated and the result screen is displayed. If the time runs out, you will be directed to the result screen.</p>**
